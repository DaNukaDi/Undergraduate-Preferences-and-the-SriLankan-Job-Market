# ANALYZING THE  IMPACT OF  UNDERGRADUATE PREFERENCES  ON THE SRI LANKAN  JOB MARKET 👨🏻‍🎓


## Introduction
  
Sri Lanka faces financial instability, prompting emigration and exacerbating unemployment. Understanding how undergraduates' choices impact the job market is vital. This analysis aims to identify factors influencing their decisions to enhance Sri Lanka's employment landscape.

## Significance of the study


We want to discover what motivates young Sri Lankans to move or search for opportunities abroad, that's why our study is essential. By determining these causes, we may discover the difficulties the Sri Lankan job market faces and explore possible solutions.


## Main objective

Examining the impact on the Sri Lankan job market based on the preferences of third-year Science Undergraduates in UOC

It appears that many people are indeed joining the Sri Lankan job market. Is this the case? According to the first pie chart, we can observe that most undergraduates are willing to enter the industry in Sri Lanka after their graduation. However, their satisfaction with the Sri Lankan job market is very low. So, what are the actual reasons for their preference?

According to the above figure, we can understand why most students are willing to join the Sri Lankan job market. A considerable number of students do not want to leave their parents and go to another country. Also, some students are facing financial instability. Therefore, we can understand that their preferences do not depend on the quality of the Sri Lankan industry.

   ### Continue Higher Studies
